* linear and nonlinear truss calculations. geometric and material nonlinear crisfield element can be used
* included tetraeder example with linear and nonlinear calculations
* truss_example shows another truss structure from the manuscript linear/nonlinear 
* still working on the PyIGA. I think the compile part should be shifted to a cloud service and the user should download the precompiled version from the cloud service (appveyor)
